# A typology of user interfaces with predictive models

## Introduction to model interfaces
Predictive models is becoming increasingly useful and important.
These models and algorithms are becoming increasingly capable.
Also, their currently increasing acceptance and use make them more important.

A key property of predictive models is the way humans can interact with them.
This interaction is a key property to make them useful for us humans.
A negative example would be interaction that creates unnecessary overhead,
which overall might render interacting with a model worse than not using it.
In contrast, we want to interact with models in *just the right* way.

In different contexts, different ways of *model interfaces* are better.
Assume the usage of weather prediction models.
You might either want a dashboard with all weather parameters for today,
or you might only want my door knob to remind me of bringing an umbrella.
Given this range of options, it is important to know which ones are available.

## Purpose: typology of model interfaces
We would like to assist at choosing the right interfaces to predictive models.
Also, this review shall assist designing new model interfaces.

This work works towards this in two steps:
Initially, design properties of model interfaces are presented.
Given these properties, interfaces to predictive models are then reviewed.
Finally, this review is summarized in a *typology of model interfaces*.

## Criteria of interface comparison
Comparing existing interfaces is structured by the following binary design properties:

1. Is data for improvement generated?
2. is user addressed actively?
3. Required skillful user?
4. Detailed insights?
5. Does deployment require webserver?
6. Do working examples exist?

## Review of interfaces with predictive models

In the following, types of model interfaces are presented.
For each type, the questions above are addressed.

**Command Line Interface (CLI).**
(e.g. terminal output from a Python script)

**Content filtered by predicted preferences.**
(e.g. online shop recommendations, Facebook stream)

**Control interfaces.**     --- other description?
(e.g. Google Nest)

**Conversation with human analyst.**
(e.g. presentation by analyst who directly used model)

**Dashboards.**
(e.g. 'Shiny App' with R)

**Input-heavy expert systems.**
(e.g. crime predictions for individual inmates)

**Interactive Chatbots.**
(e.g. chatbots for customer support)

**Standardized reports.**
(e.g. reports generated, graphics, APIs - on demand or scheduled)

**Smart daily objects.**
(e.g. a tooth brush, but smart and responsive)

**Spreadsheets.**
(e.g. Excel)

**Text notifications.**
(e.g. emails/messages on events, e.g. predicted rain)

**Virtual/augmented reality.**
(e.g. virtually flying through your data warehouse)

**Voice interfaces.**
(e.g. Cortana)
