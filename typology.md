# Model interaction typology

## Introduction to model interaction
Predictive models (and algorithms) are becoming more useful and important to us.
Models are becoming increasingly capable.
Also, their currently increasing acceptance and use make them more important.

A key property of predictive models is the way humans can interact with them.
This interaction is a key property to make them useful for us humans.
A negative example would be interaction that creates unnecessary overhead,
which overall might render interacting with a model worse than not using it.
In contrast, we want to interact with models in *just the right* way.

In different contexts, different ways of model interaction are optimal.
Taking the example of weather prediction models,
I might either want a dashboard with all weather parameters for today,
or I might only want my door knob to remind me of bringing an umbrella.
Given this range of options, it is important to know which ones are available.

## Purpose: typology of model interaction
Purpose of this work is reviewing options to interact with predictive models.
These ways will be presented in a *typology of model interaction*.
This shall make choosing the right model of interaction convenient.
Also, this compact representation shall inspire design of model interaction.

## Criterions of comparison
This comparison is driven by the following criterions:
* Generating new data to learn from?
* Actively communicating?
* Required skills by user?
* Depth of insight?
* Own webserver required?
* ...
